**Assumption**: You know the usual concepts of programming - loops, conditionals etc.

### Why
It's stupid to learn a language from scratch (or from a beginner course).

### What
A fast method to learn a new programming language or framework.

### How it works
If you know one programming language comfortably, you already have a mental model for programming languages, trust me 😃️.
So it's more *fun*, *easy* and *efficient* to just reuse parts of that abstract model.

**Don't worry about this explanation if it sounds irrelevant to you🤗️ or if my words are too techy/yucky.**

### How to use
1. Download the folder.
2. Download [Zim](https://www.zim-wiki.org). *it's a lightweight notebook tool. Works on Windows, Linux and Mac.*
3. Open the `notebook.zim` file.
