Update: Solve easy LeetCode questions with the language you want to learn.
This repo is irrelevant now.
~~**Assumption**: You know the usual concepts of programming - loops, conditionals etc.~~

### Why
It's stupid to learn a language from scratch (or from a beginner course).

### What
A fast method to learn a new programming language or framework.

### How it works
If you know one programming language comfortably, you already have a mental model for programming languages, trust me 😃️.
So it's more *fun*, *easy* and *efficient* to just reuse parts of that abstract model.

**Don't worry about this explanation if it sounds irrelevant to you🤗️ or if my words are too techy/yucky.**
