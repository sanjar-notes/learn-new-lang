====== 3. Medium 1 - Understanding basics ======
Created Saturday 13 March 2021

State
* I have finished a significant number of coding problems. Now learn the language specifically from docs/elsewhere. 
* Write down notes for all stuff(including the two hack sessions), if you want to.

=== 1. File extension/compiler/interpreter ===
[ ] What's the file extension.
[ ] How to run in a terminal.

=== 2. Variables ===
[ ] Naming rules
[ ] Declaration requires initialization?
[ ] Un-initialized variables, are they allowed, if yes, what is their value.
[ ] Has assignment expressions?
[ ] Allows in-expression declaration?
[ ] Constant variables

=== 3. Operators ===
[ ] Type casting
	[ ] Implicit vs explicit type casting for numbers, especially in mixed operations
	[ ] Casting mechanism: type(val) or (type)val.
[ ] Allows chaining of operators(x < y < z).
[ ] String behavior with other types - (str+int, str[ ]int etc)
[ ] How to get universal equivalent, maybe string.
[ ] Equality - reference based vs value(bit-by-bit) based. ''is'' vs ''=='' in Python.
[ ] Ternary operator

=== 4. Functions ===
[ ] Parameter passing implementation
	[ ] Default - in(call by reference) or out(call by value)?
	[ ] Has different behavior for primitive and non-primitive types?
	[ ] If both are allowed, how to do both.
	[ ] Write a ''swap(a, b)'' program.
[ ] Has default params?
[ ] Is function overloading(same name different signature) allowed?
[ ] temporally static variables - in C++

=== 5. Functions advanced ===
[ ] Are anonymous(unnamed) functions allowed? i.e is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately_invoked_function_expression|IIFE]] allowed? If yes, learn syntax.
[ ] Are lambdas allowed? i.e. can functions be passed as variables(data). If yes, learn syntax.
[ ] Can a function be defined inside another function?
[ ] Variadic functions

=== 6. Scoping rules ===
[ ] Has block scope, i.e do variables declared inside a block die outside it? Applies to loop [[./block_scope.py|block]], conditional block etc.
[ ] Has function scope? i.e inner functions cannot write to variables declared in the [[./function_scope.py|outer]] function?
[ ] Is global scope blocked for writing to? If yes, how to unblock it.

=== 7. Map, Filter and Reduce ===
Learn about quick iteration constructs.
[ ] map
[ ] filter
[ ] reduce
