====== 1. Fast 1 - No principles ======
Created Saturday 13 March 2021

To get familiar with the syntax and basic constructs of the program.
* Keep documentation ready but don't read it completely. There is a chance that you just remember stuff temporarily.
[ ] Solve a lot(>50) of algorithm problems of different types.
* Don't worry about code quality, atleast intially.
* Read this page and tick the bullets when you learn it.

	[ ] Truncation?
	[ ] Interaction of integer and float
[ ] Equality and comparison ops
[ ] Basical logical ops - AND, OR, NOT.
