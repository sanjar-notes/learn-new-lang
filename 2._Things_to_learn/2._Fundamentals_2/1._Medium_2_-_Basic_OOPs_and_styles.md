# 1. Medium 2 - Basic OOPs and styles
Created Sunday 14 March 2021

#### Cool features of the language

* ☐ String fields - aka f string, format strings
* ☐ List, set, dict comprehensions
* ☐ Spread operator
* ☐ Parallel assignment - unpacking, destructuring
* Do a web search of "cool features of $lang"


#### 4 Principles of OOP

* Encapsulation - decrease arguments for methods(aka functions)
* Abstraction - hide details(of dependencies/components)
* Inheritance - code reuse(for objects with common ancestors)
* Polymorphism - Runtime


#### Basic OOP

* Not required for a coding interview, unless the language is very important.
* ☐ Class syntax
* ☐ Has access modifiers? if yes what are the types. If no, how is abstraction achieved.
* ☐ Fields
* ☐ ``this`` keyword
* ☐ Access notation: functions/fields
* ☐ Basic constructor(default+parameterized)
* ☐ Creating objects
* ☐ Methods
* ☐ Destructor
* ☐ Copy constructor, copy assignment operator


#### Intermediate OOP

* ☐ Static fields and methods - shared properties/free functions.
* ☐ Function overloading - makes code streamlined.
* ☐ Single(parent) inheritance
* ☐ Multilevel inheritance
