====== 1. Why this works ======
Created Saturday 13 March 2021

* This technique works because modern programming languages are human centric(HLL - although H is not "//human"//üí°Ô∏è). 
* All useful languages do similar operations in their own style.
* It would be inefficient to study languages from scratch, assuming you know programming in atleast one language). This is because many languages assimilate/remove good/bad parts of other languages, respectively.
* Most languages still have exclusive features of their own, but the implementation of features is the same, mostly dependent on:
	* Purpose of the language - can change over time. e.g JavaScript, Java
	* Hardware infrastructure - C, C++ were designed to run on very low spec hardware

--------------------

=== Some facts ===
* All programs are a series of small steps.
* Consequently, there are 4 kinds of instruction patterns in any language:
	1. Sequential step: calculation, read/write(assignment).
	2. Selective step, checks condition(true/false).
	3. Iterative step, loops for a certain time or until a condition is met.
	4. Store and reuse for both data and code. e.g. variables, functions, classes, modules etc. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself|DRY]]

* Of course, every modern language has a lot of features of each type, because the goal is to make "high-level" languages.
